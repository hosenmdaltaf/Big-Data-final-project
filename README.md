# Big-Data-final-project
This is my final project from my university Big Data course.In Anyone get help from this repository .That will be great so that I upload it to my github.
#I try to answer some of this question:
   1) By building regression models to predict movie revenue and vote averages based on a certain metric.
   2) Analyze that what movies tend to get higher vote averages on TMDB. And tried  to use more figures with data visualization methods to illustrate my analysis.
   3) Use collaborative filtering to build a movie recommendation system with two functions:
       a)I create a model that can Suggest top N movies similar to a given movie title
       b)And Predict user rating for the movies they have not rated for

      I use TMDB movie dataset,IMDB movie dataset to solve this question.
